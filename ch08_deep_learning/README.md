# More Exercises (TODO)

In this section, after we practice the deep neural network in the book,
we will explore additional exercises to deepen your understanding of
neural networks. These exercises will cover advanced architectures and
techniques such as LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, and other tech.

## Some Networks

### LeNet
LeNet is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks, developed by
Yann LeCun and his colleagues in the late 1980s. It was primarily used for
handwritten digit recognition and consists of 2 convolutional layers followed
by 2 fully connected layers.

### AlexNet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that won the ImageNet Large Scale
Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012. It consists of 5 convolutional layers
followed by 3 fully connected layers.

### ResNet
ResNet, or Residual Network, introduced the concept of residual learning.
It allows training of very deep networks by using skip connections, which helps
to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Implementing ResNet will give you
insights into how deep networks can be trained effectively.

# Some Techniques

### Fine-Tuning
Fine-tuning is a technique where a pre-trained network is adapted to a new task.
This is particularly useful when you have limited data for the new task.
By fine-tuning a pre-trained network, you can leverage the learned features
from a large dataset and apply them to your specific problem.

### Mixed Precision Training
Mixed precision training is a technique that uses both 16-bit and 32-bit
floating-point types to speed up the training process and reduce memory usage.
By using lower precision for certain operations, you can take advantage of
faster computation and more efficient use of memory, while still maintaining
model accuracy. Implementing mixed precision training can help you train larger
models or use larger batch sizes without running into memory limitations.

### Early Stopping
Early stopping is a technique to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's
performance on a validation set and stopping the training when the performance
starts to degrade. Implementing early stopping in your training process will
help you understand how to find the optimal point to stop training and avoid
overfitting.

These exercises will provide you with hands-on experience in implementing and
understanding advanced neural network architectures and techniques.
