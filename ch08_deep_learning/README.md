# More Exercises

In this section, after we practice the deep neural network in the book,
we will explore additional exercises to deepen your understanding of
neural networks. These exercises will cover advanced architectures and
techniques such as LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, and other tech.

## Some Networks

### LeNet
LeNet is one of the earliest convolutional neural networks, developed by
Yann LeCun and his colleagues in the late 1980s. It was primarily used for
handwritten digit recognition and consists of 2 convolutional layers followed
by 2 fully connected layers.

### AlexNet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that won the ImageNet Large Scale
Visual Recognition Challenge in 2012. It consists of 5 convolutional layers
followed by 3 fully connected layers.

### ResNet
ResNet, or Residual Network, introduced the concept of residual learning.
It allows training of very deep networks by using skip connections, which helps
to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Implementing ResNet will give you
insights into how deep networks can be trained effectively.

## Try Pytorch and Tensflow
In this section, try using popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch
and TensorFlow. This will help you gain practical experience and a deeper understanding
of building and training neural networks.

### PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible and
dynamic approach to building neural networks. It is known for its ease of use
and efficient memory management, making it a popular choice for both research
and production.

### TensorFlow [TODO]
TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It
provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning
models. TensorFlow is widely used in both academia and industry for its
scalability and robustness.

## Some Techniques

### Mixed Precision Training
Mixed precision training is a technique that uses both 16-bit and 32-bit
floating-point types to speed up the training process and reduce memory usage,
while still maintaining model accuracy.

For large models, mixed precision training is a mainstream
approach, typically combining FP16 and FP32:
- **Forward and Backward Propagation**: Use FP16 to accelerate computation and
reduce memory usage.
- **Weight Updates**: Maintain the main weights in FP32 to avoid cumulative
errors caused by low precision.
- **Gradient Scaling**: Scale up the gradients of the loss function to prevent
underflow in FP16, then scale them back to the original value during updates.

### Early Stopping [TODO]
Early stopping is a technique to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's
performance on a validation set and stopping the training when the performance
starts to degrade. Implementing early stopping in your training process will
help you understand how to find the optimal point to stop training and avoid
overfitting.

### Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning [TODO]
Transfer learning uses a pre-trained model from one task as a starting point
for a new, related task. This method saves time and resources and often
improves performance, especially when the new task has limited data.

Fine-tune is a specific type of transfer learning where the pre-trained model is not only used as a starting point but also further trained (or "fine-tuned") on the new task.
